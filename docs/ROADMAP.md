## Project Roadmap

This document describes planned next steps for the `mlte` project.

### TODO

Properties
- Should be uniquely identifiable, without any possible ambiguity (designate via a UUID at the time of creation)
- Should be versioned, so we can identify the precise version that was used to generate some data
- Should have a polymorphic interface (input and output) out of necessity?
- Should include a facility for automatically detecting updates to property implementation and enforcing version updates
