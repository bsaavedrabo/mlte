### Getting Started

`mlte` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlte-python/). Install the latest version with:

```bash
$ pip install mlte-python
```

Once installed, you can head to our guide on [using MLTE](https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_mlte/) for next steps. If you just want to know how to use the package in an existing project, check out our [MLTE Mechanics](https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mlte_mechanics/) guide. If you're interested in reading about the project more generally, see our [documentation](https://mlte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Citing This Work

If you're interested in learning more about this work, you can read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01998). While not required, it is highly encouraged and greatly appreciated if you cite our paper when you use MLTE for academic research.
